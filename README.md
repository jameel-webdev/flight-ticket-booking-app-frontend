# Ticket Booking App

I created a flight ticket booking application using a tech stack called MERN, which includes MongoDB, React, Express.js, and Node.js. The goal was to design a simple user interface with easy navigation for booking tickets. I integrated Razorpay for payments and focused on providing a user-friendly seat selection interface.

To enhance the user experience, I used wireframes to design a straightforward UI. Additionally, I incorporated Faker.js to generate realistic data, ensuring a fresh look for new users or reviewers. However, the signup and signin processes experienced delays due to the data generation time (approximately 200ms).

For future updates, I plan to introduce features for updating bookings, users and optimize both the frontend and backend for improved performance.
